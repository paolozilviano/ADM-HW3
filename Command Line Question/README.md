While dealing with the Command Line Question, as every member of this group had Windows OS we used two different machines to do the job.
With the first (a computer from the equipment of via Tiburtina labs) we merged the tsv files; once we uploaded the 6000 tsv documents obtained with the parsing part, we merged them with a single command line as you can see in the provided screenshot (*merging_file_with_Linux_on_Sapienza_computer.png*).


After that we created an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS in order to be able to do operations with Linux commands on the merged file downloaded from the lab's computer and retrieve the information required for the homework.
At first we uploaded our .sh file (*CommandLine.sh*) and the merged file called *merged_courses* and then as you can see in the screenshot *prompt_screenshot_clq.jpg* before executing the shell file we did some operation to make it run succesfully:
* ```bhujn```
